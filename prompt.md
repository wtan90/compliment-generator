## Save compliments to Firebase
I'd like to build a Compliment Generator that randomly selects compliments from a Firebase Realtime Database and displays them to users.

First, program the submission form to let users add new compliments to the database. Use my Firebase config and existing project code as a reference:

```
```

Please add detailed comments to the new code to help me understand it.

## Retrieve compliments
Next, write the functionality that gets the compliments data from Firebase, then displays a random compliment to the user each time they click the generate button.

## Message display
Add the necessary code to display a "success" message once the user submits a compliment to the database. The message should disappear after 3 seconds.
